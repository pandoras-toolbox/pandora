# Pandora

A showcase for first-class end-to-end test automation.

First the [payroll](payroll/README.md) application has to be started.

Then API tests can be run inside the [payroll-api-test](payroll-api-test/README.md) module.

Later we will implement a web frontend for the Payroll app, add GUI tests, add load tests and many other things.

Work in progress ...
